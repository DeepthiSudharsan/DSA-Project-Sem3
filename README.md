## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING PROJECT (END-SEMESTER)

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

Devise a way to represent an Incidence/Adjacency list using a ConsSet to represent the entire graph; ConsGraph, implementing the Graph Interface
and using a ConsSet inside the class. Rewrite the Prims and Dijkstra's algorithms for the ConsGraph implementation. Compare the time performance
of the implementation to MatrixGraph
